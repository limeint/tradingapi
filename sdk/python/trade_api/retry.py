"""Retry policy and interceptors for transient gRPC failures.

Applies exponential backoff to unary calls that fail with UNAVAILABLE.

``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`` (429) is **not** retried by default — a 429 means the
server is throttling us, and blind retries amplify the throttle. We retry it
only when the server explicitly invites a retry via the
``grpc-retry-pushback-ms`` trailing metadata, in which case the pushback
delay overrides the configured backoff for that attempt.

Streaming calls are not retried automatically — the caller drives the
iteration and can re-subscribe at a meaningful point (e.g. resuming from
the last received bar).
